# Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python
I'm going to use the 
Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a 
fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed 
and difficulty. At the end of the project, I’ll have learned skills that will 
enable to develop  2D games in Pygame.

## How the game works

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears 
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship 
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the 
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky 
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and 
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet 
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits 
the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player 
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
